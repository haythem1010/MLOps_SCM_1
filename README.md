## Introduction to Machine Learning & MLOps

### üß† Machine Learning (ML)


Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that allows systems to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed. It is widely used in areas such as:

- Image and speech recognition
- Predictive analytics
- Recommendation systems
- Natural language processing


#### Core Steps in ML:

1. **Data Collection**
2. **Data Preprocessing**
3. **Model Training**
4. **Evaluation**
5. **Deployment**

### ‚öôÔ∏è MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)

MLOps is the practice of combining **Machine Learning** and **DevOps** to automate and streamline the lifecycle of ML models in production.

### Key Components:

-# **Versioning** of data and models
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
- **Monitoring and logging**
- **Model retraining and rollback**

MLOps helps in scaling ML workflows and maintaining reliable, reproducible, and efficient pipelines.
